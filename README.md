# QR Code Component Challenge

## Introduction

This project is centered around building a responsive QR code component, designed to improve front-end development skills through practical application. The QR code component is the focal point of a landing page that invites users to scan the code to visit a certain webpage and elevate their coding expertise.

The technology stack for this webpage includes:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Bootstrap (latest version)
- Git for version control

## Description

The creation of this webpage was an innovative process that leveraged Generative AI assistance. With the AI's guidance, the design was conceptualized and implemented using different CSS frameworks to demonstrate versatility and a deep understanding of responsive design principles.

Each CSS framework - Flexbox, CSS Grid, and Bootstrap - has been employed to construct the page layout and styling, ensuring the design is both aesthetically pleasing and functionally robust across a range of devices and screen sizes.

In the repository, you'll find separate branches dedicated to each styling method:

- The `main` branch holds the Bootstrap implementation, offering a modern and mobile-first approach to responsiveness.
- The `dev` branch showcases the use of Flexbox, providing a streamlined method for laying out, aligning, and distributing space among items within a container.
- The `dev_cssgrid` branch demonstrates the application of CSS Grid, highlighting the ability to create complex layouts with simplicity and control.

Each branch stands as a testament to the flexibility and possibilities within the realm of CSS frameworks. Users are encouraged to explore the different branches to see the various implementations and to choose the one that best suits their needs or preferences for responsive design.
